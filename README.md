# Minesweeper
Classic single player game ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸš©ðŸš©

Single player arcade game in which you eliminate enemy ships.</br>
I did it with the help of the udemy [courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/programowanie-obiektowe-w-javascript/). I added my own solutions to this game.</br>
The game created with using new not supported private classes methods. The game isn' t working on Firefox.</br>

## How to play?
Choose difficulty level, in every single levels you have different number of mines. The numbers inside the cells inform you how many mines is around this cell. Reveal all cells without mines and won the game.

## My solutions
I added some code improvements. I changed shoot listener. Now if you hold down a space bar, the shoot will automatically after one second. If you start new game the missiles are removed from playing field.
